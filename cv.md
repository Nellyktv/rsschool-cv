## About me:


I chose front-end development because... I'm interested in creating achievements and creating clear interfaces for web applications. I love the ability for users to visually and interactively interact with websites and applications. I am also attracted by the fact that technology does not stand still and there is an opportunity for constant growth in this industry. I like to puzzle over complex problems and come up with their implementation.
